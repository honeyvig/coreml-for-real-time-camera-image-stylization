# coreml-for-real-time-camera-image-stylization
To implement real-time camera image stylization using Core ML, you need to set up a model for image style transfer (stylization) and run it on the camera feed in real-time.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how you can do this with Core ML and ARKit:
Prerequisites:

    Xcode and an Apple Developer account.
    A trained Core ML model for image stylization. You can either use a pre-trained model or train your own.
        For example, you could use a Neural Style Transfer model, which applies artistic filters to images.

Steps to Implement Real-Time Camera Image Stylization:

    Set up a Core ML model for image stylization: You need a model that can take a regular image and transform it into a stylized version. You can find pre-trained models or train your own. For this guide, let's assume you already have a Core ML model (StyleTransfer.mlmodel).

    Create an iOS App with Camera Feed using AVFoundation: We'll capture frames from the camera, process them with the Core ML model, and display the result in real-time.

    Run Style Transfer on Captured Camera Frames: The core idea is to:
        Capture a frame from the camera.
        Use the Core ML model to stylize the frame.
        Display the stylized image.

    @IBOutlet weak var previewView: UIView!
    
    var cameraSession: AVCaptureSession?
    var cameraPreviewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
    var stylizationModel: VNCoreMLModel?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Load the Core ML model
        loadStyleTransferModel()

        // Setup the camera feed
        setupCamera()
    }

    func loadStyleTransferModel() {
        // Assuming you have a model named "StyleTransfer.mlmodel"
        guard let styleTransferModel = try? VNCoreMLModel(for: StyleTransfer().model) else {
            fatalError("Failed to load the model.")
        }
        self.stylizationModel = styleTransferModel
    }

    func setupCamera() {
        cameraSession = AVCaptureSession()

        let videoDeviceInput: AVCaptureDeviceInput
        do {
            videoDeviceInput = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: videoDevice)
        } catch {
            return
        }
        
        // Add input to the session
        if cameraSession.canAddInput(videoDeviceInput) {
            cameraSession.addInput(videoDeviceInput)
        }

        // Setup the output
        let videoDataOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
        if cameraSession.canAddOutput(videoDataOutput) {
            cameraSession.addOutput(videoDataOutput)
            
            videoDataOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))
        }

        // Setup the preview layer to display the camera feed
        cameraPreviewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: cameraSession)
        cameraPreviewLayer?.frame = previewView.bounds
        cameraPreviewLayer?.videoGravity = .resizeAspectFill
        previewView.layer.addSublayer(cameraPreviewLayer!)

        // Start the camera session
        cameraSession.startRunning()
    }

    func processCameraFrame(_ image: CIImage) {
        // Use Core ML to apply style transfer
        guard let stylizationModel = self.stylizationModel else { return }
        
        let request = VNCoreMLRequest(model: stylizationModel) { (request, error) in
            if let results = request.results as? [VNPixelBufferObservation], let pixelBuffer = results.first?.pixelBuffer {
                // Convert the stylized pixel buffer to UIImage
                let outputImage = UIImage(ciImage: CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: pixelBuffer))
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    // Update the preview with the stylized image
                    self.previewView.layer.contents = outputImage.cgImage
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Create a handler to perform the style transfer
        let handler = VNImageRequestHandler(ciImage: image, options: [:])
        do {
            try handler.perform([request])
        } catch {
            print("Error during image processing: \(error)")

// MARK: - AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate

extension ViewController: AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        // Get the pixel buffer from the sample buffer
        guard let imageBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else { return }

        // Convert the pixel buffer to CIImage
        let ciImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: imageBuffer)

        // Process the frame with Core ML
        processCameraFrame(ciImage)
    }
}

Explanation:

    AVCaptureSession: This class manages the flow of data from input devices (like the camera) to outputs (like a display or file).
    VNCoreMLModel: This class represents a Core ML model that can be used with Vision framework. You load the pre-trained style transfer model here.
    VNCoreMLRequest: This object performs the model inference. It takes a VNCoreMLModel and processes input images.
    AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate: This delegate method is called every time the camera outputs a new frame. You get the sample buffer from the camera, convert it to a CIImage, and pass it through the Core ML model for stylization.
    Preview Layer: The AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer displays the real-time camera feed in the app.

Handling Core ML Model:

The model StyleTransfer.mlmodel should take an image and stylize it. You can use models trained for style transfer like the Fast Neural Style Transfer or other similar models.

You can also train your own Core ML model using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch and convert it to Core ML using the coremltools package.
Core ML Model Conversion:

If you're using a model trained outside of Core ML (e.g., in TensorFlow or PyTorch), you can convert it to Core ML using:

python -m tfcoreml.convert --input_model your_model.pb --output_model StyleTransfer.mlmodel

Make sure your model is optimized for real-time inference, as image stylization can be computationally expensive.
Final Thoughts:

This code shows how to integrate Core ML with a live camera feed and perform real-time image stylization. You can further optimize the model for performance and enhance the user experience by minimizing the latency between capturing frames and displaying the stylized output.

Let's break down how the code provided for real-time camera image stylization using Core ML can be further elaborated in a real-world scenario. This includes practical examples and additional considerations such as performance, user experience, and potential optimizations.
Real-World Use Case: Live Stylized Camera Filter App

Imagine we are building a live camera filter app where users can apply artistic effects (such as turning a regular photo into a painting or a sketch) in real-time using their camera. The goal is to take the camera feed, process each frame using a style transfer model, and display the output immediately as the user interacts with the app.
Breakdown of the Real-Time Process

    Capturing Real-Time Camera Feed:
        The camera is continuously capturing video frames.
        The app must process these frames as they are received and then output the result (stylized image) on the screen.

    Core ML Model for Stylization:
        A Core ML model (trained on Neural Style Transfer) is used to apply an artistic effect, like transforming an image into a painting.
        The model takes each video frame as input, processes it, and outputs a transformed image that looks like an artwork.

    Using the Core ML Model with Vision Framework:
        Vision (VNCoreMLModel and VNCoreMLRequest) is used to integrate Core ML with the app.
        For each camera frame, we run the style transfer model and display the output on a preview layer.

    Optimizing Performance:
        Since image style transfer can be computationally expensive, optimizations like lowering resolution and asynchronous processing can help.
        We may also use a multi-threaded approach to avoid blocking the main UI thread.

    var cameraSession: AVCaptureSession?
    var cameraPreviewLayer: AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer?
    var stylizationModel: VNCoreMLModel?
    var isProcessingFrame = false  // Prevent multiple frame processes at the same time
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Load the Core ML model for style transfer
        loadStyleTransferModel()

        // Setup and start the camera feed
        setupCamera()
    }

    func loadStyleTransferModel() {
        // Load the pre-trained style transfer Core ML model (adjust the model name as needed)
        guard let model = try? VNCoreMLModel(for: StyleTransfer().model) else {
            fatalError("Failed to load the model.")

        guard let videoDevice = AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .video) else { return }
        let videoDeviceInput: AVCaptureDeviceInput
        do {
            videoDeviceInput = try AVCaptureDeviceInput(device: videoDevice)
        } catch {
            return
        }

        // Add input to the session
        if cameraSession.canAddInput(videoDeviceInput) {
            cameraSession.addInput(videoDeviceInput)
        }

        // Setup the output for the camera
        let videoDataOutput = AVCaptureVideoDataOutput()
        if cameraSession.canAddOutput(videoDataOutput) {
            cameraSession.addOutput(videoDataOutput)
            
            // Set up the delegate for capturing video frames
            videoDataOutput.setSampleBufferDelegate(self, queue: DispatchQueue(label: "videoQueue"))
        }

        // Preview layer for displaying camera feed
        cameraPreviewLayer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(session: cameraSession)
        cameraPreviewLayer?.frame = previewView.bounds
        cameraPreviewLayer?.videoGravity = .resizeAspectFill
        previewView.layer.addSublayer(cameraPreviewLayer!)

        // Start the camera session to capture video
        cameraSession.startRunning()
    }

    func processCameraFrame(_ image: CIImage) {
        // Ensure we are not processing frames too fast
        guard !isProcessingFrame else { return }
        isProcessingFrame = true
        
        // Perform the Core ML request to stylize the image
        guard let stylizationModel = self.stylizationModel else { return }

        let request = VNCoreMLRequest(model: stylizationModel) { [weak self] (request, error) in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error during style transfer: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                self?.isProcessingFrame = false
                return
            }
            
            guard let results = request.results as? [VNPixelBufferObservation], let pixelBuffer = results.first?.pixelBuffer else {
                self?.isProcessingFrame = false

            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                // Display the stylized image in the preview view

                self?.isProcessingFrame = false
            }
        }

            try handler.perform([request])
        } catch {
            print("Error during image processing: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            isProcessingFrame = false
        }
    }
}

// MARK: - AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate

extension ViewController: AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate {
    func captureOutput(_ output: AVCaptureOutput, didOutput sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, from connection: AVCaptureConnection) {
        // Capture frame from camera feed
        guard let imageBuffer = CMSampleBufferGetImageBuffer(sampleBuffer) else { return }

        // Convert captured frame to CIImage
        let ciImage = CIImage(cvPixelBuffer: imageBuffer)

        // Process the frame with Core ML model
        processCameraFrame(ciImage)
    }
}

Detailed Explanation of the App Flow:

    Load Core ML Model:
        In the loadStyleTransferModel() method, we load the pre-trained Core ML model (StyleTransfer.mlmodel). The model is assumed to perform neural style transfer, taking an input image and returning a stylized output image.

    Setup Camera Input & Output:
        The camera is set up using AVCaptureSession, and the video feed is captured with AVCaptureDevice and AVCaptureDeviceInput.
        AVCaptureVideoDataOutputSampleBufferDelegate receives the camera frames, which are passed for processing.

    Stylization:
        The real-time frames from the camera are converted into CIImage format and passed to the Core ML model for processing.
        We use Vision (VNCoreMLRequest) to send the image through the model and get the stylized output in the form of a CVPixelBuffer.

    Display Result:
        Once the Core ML model has processed the frame, the result is converted to a UIImage and displayed on the screen in the previewView.

Optimizations and Considerations:

    Frame Processing Rate:
        Processing every frame from the camera can be computationally expensive. To avoid performance bottlenecks, we use the isProcessingFrame flag to ensure that we only process one frame at a time, preventing unnecessary re-processing.

    Resolution Adjustments:
        For smoother real-time performance, consider reducing the resolution of the input images (e.g., resizing the camera feed to a smaller resolution before processing). This can significantly improve speed while sacrificing some detail.

    Asynchronous Processing:
        The style transfer is processed asynchronously to avoid blocking the main thread, ensuring that the UI remains responsive and smooth.

    User Interaction:
        In a more advanced implementation, you could provide users with multiple style filters (e.g., impressionism, cubism, abstract) by swapping the Core ML model dynamically or changing styles on a per-frame basis.

Example User Flow:

    The user opens the app and sees the live camera feed on the screen.
    The camera feed is automatically stylized into an artistic painting, such as a Van Gogh style or a pencil sketch.
    The user can see the filtered image in real-time as they move the camera around.
    Optionally, the app could allow users to take photos or save videos of their stylized content.

Additional Enhancements:

    User Controls: Allow users to toggle between different artistic styles (i.e., swap models).
    Capture Button: Implement a feature where the user can capture the stylized image and save it to their photo library.
    Performance Optimization: Use a lower resolution for processing frames to achieve real-time performance without sacrificing too much quality.

Conclusion:

This setup demonstrates how to create a real-time camera stylization app using Core ML and Vision. The app applies a style transfer model to each frame captured by the camera feed and displays the output in real-time. Performance optimizations, such as asynchronous processing and limiting the frame rate, are essential for providing a smooth user experience.
